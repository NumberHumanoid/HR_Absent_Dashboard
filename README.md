## Project Overview
This project focuses on utilizing employee data to support and reward a healthy lifestyle among employees. The primary objectives are to identify employees with healthy lifestyles, propose a rewards system, and create a dashboard for HR to monitor absenteeism and health metrics.

## Database Creation and SQL Queries
**Database Setup**: Created a database named "work" in Microsoft SQL Server Studio to manage employee data.
**Data Import**: Imported data into the database using flat CSV files. Tables included absenteeism, employee details, and compensation data.
SQL Development: Developed SQL queries for data extraction and manipulation, focusing on joins, data aggregation, and filtering.

## Data Analysis and SQL Development
**Criteria Definition**: Defined criteria for identifying healthy employees (non-smokers and non-drinkers with a BMI under 25) and low absenteeism.
**SQL Analysis**: Created complex SQL queries to filter and identify employees meeting the health criteria. Utilized SQL functions like AVG, COUNT, and case statements for categorizing data.

## Data Visualization with Power BI
**Dashboard Creation**: Connected the SQL database to Power BI and used the optimized SQL query to import data.
**Wireframe and Dashboard Design**: Followed an HR-approved wireframe to create an interactive dashboard. The dashboard provides insights into absenteeism trends, employee health metrics, and breakdowns by various categories (e.g., BMI, smoking status).
**KPIs and Visualizations**: Incorporated key performance indicators like average absenteeism and total hours worked. Utilized Power BI features like pie charts, trend lines, and scatter plots to visualize the data.

## Project Results and Deliverables
* **Healthy Employee List**: Provided a list of employees eligible for the health bonus, based on the defined health criteria.
* **Compensation Analysis for Non-Smokers**: Calculated the wage increase for non-smokers within the allocated budget.
* **Interactive Dashboard**: Delivered a Power BI dashboard to HR for monitoring and analyzing absenteeism and employee health metrics.

## Tools Used:
* **Microsoft SQL Server Studio** (Database Management)
* **Power BI**  (Data Visualization & Dashboard creation)
